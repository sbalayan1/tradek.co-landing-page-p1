// initializes NextAuth.js using App Router
// import NextAuth from 'next-auth'

// const handler = NextAuth({

// })

// export { handler as GET, handler as POST} // NextAuth.js detects that it is being initialized in a Route Handler (by understanding that it is passed a Web Request instance) and returns a handler that returns a Response instance. A Route Handler file expects you to export some named handler functions that handle a request and return a response. NextAuth.js needs the GET and POST handlers to function properly, so we export those two.
